    "description": "This Twitter bot sifts through posts from r/succulents (a subreddit on Reddit) and then tweets out a picture once it finds a valid one. It's coded using Node.js and implements a NoSQL database via Redis, which ensures that post ID comparisons aren't lost if the process were to stop. Right now it is hosted for free with Glitch.",

Rendering in canvas is clunky, but can be fun.",
